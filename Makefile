# Following will find and include yaamake makefiles, which defines lot of rules.
# Basically yaamake has generic implementation of rules show in Makefile.alternative.
# Purpose of yaamake is to make this project specific makefile as simple as possible.
# Yaamake is installed on computers in the exercise lab, but if you need it on your
#  computer get it from https://github.com/raphendyr/yaamake
# If you do not want or can't use yaamake, use the provided MAkefile.alternative instead.
include $(shell yaamake --include-path --require 1.1)

# run 'make help' for more information
